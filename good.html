      <p class="subtitle">They Are Good! :D</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="subpara"> Sweatshops can be good at times. They provide the people in need who need a job a job. The pay is low but it is a type of sustainable income. In the article "Where sweatshop are a dream, It talks about how they live which most families live in shacks on smoking garbage. This is a social facter because the whole family dont have enough income to get a better house and they cant have anyone over because they will be embaressed with their house. The Article isRelevent to the topic and it talks about why they are good but it is not up to date as it has been published in 2009."</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Sometimes they are bad :(</p>
      <P></P>
      <P class="subpara">Most people think that sweatshops are bad. This is because they think that the environment is very dangioures due to all the machines working and the shifts that they work. sometimes as 8 hour shifts, 12 hour shifts and sometimes 24 hour shifts</P>
      <p class="subpara"> In the Article "Where sweatshops are a dream", it meantions about most children working at a garbade dump scavenging for plastic to give and and earn a bit less than $1 a day which is crazy! This is a Economical factor because You cannot live on $1 a day to buy food, clothes and living necesities. A 13 year old Named Neuo Chanthou sister has had their hand ran over by a garbage truck while picking up plastic. Even tho they Have advanced technology, it is much safer for them to be working at a sweatshop.</p>
      <p class="subpara">This is a Law Factor as Politics need to take care and take actions on this as this is causing the employees to commit suicide. it may be the working conditions what may be causing this.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Opinion from other people</p>
      <p class="subpara">Oliwier broniszewski said that sweatshops are good. this is because working at a sweatshop prevents little children and normal children from doing something dangioures at a garbage dump and getting their hand ran over. He got this information from the article called "where sweatshops are a dream", This info was near the end of it saying "who lost a part of her hand when a garbage truck ran her over". This is a technical factor because if the trucks are so advanced, why do they not have the feature to detect people and warn the driver?</p>
      <p class="subpara">In my Opinion, i think that sweatshops are a good thing. This is because They help out people who really are living a bad life. even tho working at a sweatshop is bad but is great for people who are in poverty and need something to live on.</p>
      <p class="subpara"> In the Apple Article, It talks about the living and working environment they have to live and work in. There have been alot of Suicide attempts (19 in total) and one succeeded in doing so. Then they had to install suicide nets to help prevent more suicide attempts.</p>
      <p class="subpara">This is a Law Factor as Politics need to take care and take actions on this as this is causing the employees to commit suicide. it may be the working conditions what may be causing this.</p>
