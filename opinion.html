  <p class="subtitle"> My Opinion</p>
  <p class="subpara">In my Opinion, i think that sweatshops are a good thing. This is because They help out people who really are living a bad life. even tho working at a sweatshop is bad but is great for people who are in poverty and need something to live on.</p>
  <p class="subpara"> Also, even tho the working conditions are bad, it is workable. it will be a hard job but it will provide some ,kind of income. Sweatshops also include accomidation for a very cheap price in a shared room so they will have somewhere to live instead of a dump.</p>
  <p class="subpara">Lastb but not least, This just improves their life a whole lot better. They will probably have a bad background of their life and if they work in a sweatshop, it will just improve their life</p>
